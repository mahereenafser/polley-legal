# Change Log - Mobile Navbar & Numeric Claims Verification

**Date:** 2025-10-13

---

## Part A: Mobile Navbar Color Consistency

### Issue
The mobile hamburger menu was changing to an "off green" color (`bg-green-600/95`) after scrolling, which differed from the hero section opened-state color.

### Fix Applied
**File:** `src/components/sections/navigation.tsx` (Line 221)

**Change:**
- **Before:** Conditional color: `scrolled ? "bg-green-600/95" : "bg-[#1E3432]/95"`
- **After:** Consistent color: `"bg-[#1E3432]/95"` (removed conditional)

**Result:** The mobile hamburger menu now uses the exact same color (`#1E3432` at 95% opacity) as the hero opened-state at all scroll positions, maintaining the glassmorphic backdrop-blur-xl effect.

3. **Accessibility:** All color contrast ratios preserved; no accessibility regressions.

4. **Mobile Responsiveness:** All changes work correctly across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
